description: Being organized has always been a part of who I am, for better or for worse. Since college, I have become increasingly interested in / fascinated by / borderline obsessed with productivity.

Being organized has always been a part of who I am, for better or for worse. Since college, I have become increasingly interested in / fascinated by / borderline obsessed with productivity. I am always thinking about how to be efficient and effective, and it boils down to how I spend my time. In this post, I will share what I call “my productivity journey“ and the learnings I have had along the way. I will also share my current process.

<blockquote style="text-align:center;">“Being busy is a form of laziness – lazy thinking and indiscriminate action. Being overwhelmed is often as unproductive as doing nothing, and is far more unpleasant. Being selective – doing less – is the path of the productive. Focus on the important few and ignore the rest.”
