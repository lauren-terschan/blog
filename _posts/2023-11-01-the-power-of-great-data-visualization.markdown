I started my career analyzing real estate data at one of the most influential financial institutions in the world. I found, cleaned, interpreted, and analyzed data. My favorite part of the process, comes at the end - creating an impactful, and colorful, data visualization to tell the story of my findings. Great data visualizations are powerful and I share my thoughts on just how powerful they can be in this article.


<blockquote style="text-align:center;">My favorite part about visualizing data is that there is always an opportunity to create something new.</blockquote> 

While data collection, cleaning, and analysis have some wiggle room for how the jobs get done, the ultimate goal will always be the same – find validated and accurate data, remove outliers, adjust data types, appropriately restructure the data, and run statistical analyses based on tried and true methodologies. 

But the data visualization and the story that you tell with the results is where the magic really happens. This answers the question "so what?" to why you began researching this topic in the first place. The graphical representation allows you to combine your expertise and experience with the objective results of the data.

#### Challenge the status quo

Both professionally and beyond, I challenge the status quo way of thinking or problem-solving. I have heard many times "we do it this way, because we always have” and actively combat that complacency by finding innovative approaches and solutions to what we are currently facing. My goal isn't to change for the sake of change, and I don't always have the "right" answer, but what I do try to influence is a way of thinking that opens up more possibilities. This broader perspective that I hold translates to how I personally develop visualizations and graphics for the work I produce. There is no one size fits all approach or final result.


In addition to creating the story and visuals that seamlessly reflect the information to be shown, I LOVE using color as a powerful tool in my creations. An important element to keep in mind is to create visually pleasing graphics that are also color-blind friendly. I think it's important for all who are able to see the graphic have a pleasant experience in doing so.
