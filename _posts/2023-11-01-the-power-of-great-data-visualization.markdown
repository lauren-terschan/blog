I started my career analyzing real estate data at one of the most influential financial institutions in the world. I found, cleaned, interpreted, and analyzed data. My favorite part of the process, comes at the end - creating an impactful, and colorful, data visualization to tell the story of my findings. Great data visualizations are powerful and I share my thoughts on just how powerful they can be in this article.


My favorite part about visualizing data is that there is always an opportunity to create something new. While data collection, cleaning, and analysis have some wiggle room, and how the jobs get done, the ultimate goal will always be the same – find validated, accurate data; remove outliers, adjust data types, and appropriately restructure the data; and run some sort of statistical analysis based on tried and true methodologies. Put the data, visualization element, and the story that you tell with the results that you find is where the magic really happens. This is that "so what?" To why you began researching this topic in the first place. The graphical representation allows you to combine your expertise and experience with the objective results of the data.


Both professionally and beyond, I challenge the status quo way of thinking or problem-solving. I have heard so many times "we do it this way, because we always have” and actively combat that complacency by trying to find innovative approaches and solutions to what we are currently facing. My goal typically isn't to include change for the sake of change, and I don't always have the "right" answer, but what I do try to influence is a way of thinking that opens up more possibilities. This broader perspective that I hold translates to how I personally develop visualizations and graphics for the work I produce. There is no one size fits all approach or final result.


In addition to creating the story and visuals that seamlessly reflect the information to be shown, I LOVE using color as a powerful tool in my creations. The one caveat that I am well aware of is creating visually pleasing graphics that are also color blind friendly. I think it's important for all who are able to see the graphic have a pleasant experience in doing so. 


For me, I have produced data visualizations in a variety of tools, including Microsoft Excel, the programming language R, the data, visualization, software tableau, and also in presentation decks where there maybe more manual elements, but there is even more freedom in what kind of graphic I produce. Each tool has its unique approach and process to developing visualizations that are valuable in their own way. When selecting a tool to build a visualization in, it's always important to understand how the information will be shared. For example, if you use tableau server, which allows you to publish your tableau workbook, which is then shareable via a web link, you are able to share that work with anyone with access to that server. Alternatively, I have given a number of presentations where everything was compiled in PowerPoint slides that were sent to the conference coordinator ahead of time. In these cases, I may compile my visuals from a multitude of these sources, and include static images in the final deck I discuss.


Moving on from my personal approach, I believe the single most powerful tool of a great data visualization is its ability to influence. When you've done your homework and know that the messaging is clear and not contradictory or confusing, the visual impact of a well designed graphic can be that of a picture. We have all heard the phrase "a picture is worth 1000 words.” Imagine creating some thing with that type of impact. Particularly in the cases where your audience might not have you there to explain what is being shown, it is absolutely critical to have straightforward results presented. (Review this - flow) influential data visualizations might connect with the viewers emotions, potentially eliciting a spark that eventually grows into action (if that is the intent of your work).


Let's take a look at a trivial example.
I will share more about my keen interest in personal finance in other articles, but here is an example of what I may create to help me reach a savings goal. In particular, I am very excited about reaching this goal, so I’d like to create something that will consistently entice me to save more.

In the first visual, it’s clear to see the higher saving rate leads me to my goal the fastest. This shows what I intuitively know and isn’t very impactful. Let’s take a different approach.


The economist in me notes that the opportunity cost of the three timelines is what is impactful. Assuming the additional saving between the three options doesn’t significantly impact my standard of living, we can focus on what can be done over the same 20 months (longest time horizon) if I pursue the most aggressive saving option.


To keep the example centered on financials and similar formatting, I modified the visual above to show how much total saving is possible over the 20-month time horizon. The lighter shaded section showing “# months leftover” is the amount of time until 20-months after the $10k goal is met.
